ft_asteroid_vaporizer

fetches the amount of asteroids left using ft_asteroid_count
initializes direction to Q_TOPRIGHT
initialize a list called ast_register

we send the coordinates out to ft_asteroid_del



ft_asteroid_del

check if the coordinates fall within the array (maxsize and 0)
if not? return;

we take the coordinates, check if the number is round using ft_fcoord_isround
if it's round we check the array to see if there's an asteroid on that location
if there is an asteroid, we then remove it and add the coordinates to the ast_register
